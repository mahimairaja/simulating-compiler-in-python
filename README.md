To simulate and understand the working principle of compiler and its functionalities.


1. To perform Lexical Analysis for a source program. ( Python )

2. To generate symbol table for given statement or function call. ( Python )

3. To simulate micro-processor ( Python )

4. To perform Lexical Analysis for a source program. ( LEX )

5. To simulate single pass assembler - generate object program code ( Python )

6. To simulate Deterministic Finite Automata ( Python )

7. To simulate Predictive Parsing ( Python )

8. To simulate Absolute Loader ( Python )

9. To Perform basic arithmetic operations ( YACC )

10. To generate three address code - Intermediate Code ( Python )
